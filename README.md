# FreeBindCraft: BindCraft with Optional PyRosetta Bypass

## Aurora XPU port

This repository includes an Aurora port for Intel XPU accelerators. Follow
[`aurora/README.md`](aurora/README.md) for the Aurora installer, environment,
and end-to-end run instructions.

### Quick installation on Aurora

Run this on an Aurora login node. Keep the checkout and environment on shared
project storage; change `FRAME-IDP` if your allocation uses another project
directory. This installs the pinned environment, builds the Aurora-compatible
FASPR tool, and stages the AlphaFold parameters.

```bash
export AURORA_PROJECT_ROOT="/lus/flare/projects/FRAME-IDP/${USER}"
mkdir -p "$AURORA_PROJECT_ROOT"
cd "$AURORA_PROJECT_ROOT"
git clone https://github.com/moeenmeigooni/FreeBindCraft-Aurora.git
cd FreeBindCraft-Aurora
bash aurora/install_FreeBindCraft.sh
```

For the XPU smoke and bounded end-to-end design commands, see
[Aurora setup and run instructions](aurora/README.md).

This repository contains a modified version of Martin Pacesa's BindCraft (v1.52). The primary change is the introduction of an **optional PyRosetta bypass mechanism**.

For comprehensive details on the original BindCraft pipeline, features, advanced settings, and filter explanations, please refer to the **original BindCraft repository: [https://github.com/martinpacesa/BindCraft](https://github.com/martinpacesa/BindCraft)** and the [original preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.30.615802). This fork is hosted at: [https://github.com/cytokineking/FreeBindCraft](https://github.com/cytokineking/FreeBindCraft).

## Key Modification: PyRosetta Bypass Functionality

The `--no-pyrosetta` flag, usable during both installation and runtime, enables the following behavior:

*   **OpenMM Relaxation:** Structural relaxation uses an OpenMM-based protocol instead of PyRosetta's FastRelax. This includes structure preparation with PDBFixer, ramped backbone restraints, OBC2 implicit solvation, an additional short-range repulsive term to mitigate clashes, and short MD "shakes" for early stages. Integration with FASPR (Fast, Accurate, and Deterministic Protein Side-chain Packing) for side-chain repacking and further refinement. This function is GPU-accelerated and typically is 2-4x faster than the CPU-based FastRelax, depending on the platform. OpenMM and FASPR are both open-source.
*   **Shape Complementarity (SC):** Replaced with an open-source implementation via `sc-rs` when available. See `sc-rs` project: [https://github.com/cytokineking/sc-rs](https://github.com/cytokineking/sc-rs). The results of sc-rs are nearly identical to the same calculations performed by PyRosetta.
*   **SASA Calculations:** Surface area and derived metrics are computed using [FreeSASA](https://github.com/mittinatten/freesasa) or a Biopython Shrake–Rupley fallback. These values align closely with the PyRosetta-derived values.
*   **Interface Residues and Alignment:** Uses Biopython-based routines for interface residue identification, RMSD, and PDB alignment.

**Important Note:** Rosetta-specific metrics that lack open-source equivalents are not computed; placeholder values are used where needed for compatibility with default filters. Evaluate design quality accordingly.

## ipSAE Scoring

FreeBindCraft includes support for **ipSAE (interface predicted Structural Alignment Error)**, a metric for evaluating protein-protein interface quality based on AlphaFold's PAE matrix. This implementation is based on [Dunbrack et al. (2025)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.10.637595v1).

**What is ipSAE?**
- ipSAE transforms interface PAE values using a PTM-style scoring function with adaptive normalization
- Higher scores indicate better predicted interface quality (range 0–1)
- Unlike i_pTM which uses a global d0, ipSAE uses per-residue d0 based on the number of interface contacts
- ipSAE is computed for both trajectory statistics and final MPNN design statistics

**Ranking by ipSAE:**
By default, final designs are ranked by `i_pTM`. You can optionally rank by `ipSAE` instead:

```bash
python bindcraft.py --settings ... --rank-by ipSAE
```

The interactive CLI (both local and Docker) also prompts for ranking method selection.

### Technical Overview & Rationale

For the motivation behind the PyRosetta bypass, implementation details (OpenMM relax, FreeSASA/Biopython SASA, `sc-rs` shape complementarity), and empirical impact on filter decisions, see the in-depth technical overview:

- `technical_overview/FreeBindCraft_Technical_Overview.md`

## Installation

1.  Clone this modified repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cytokineking/FreeBindCraft [install_folder]
    ```
2.  Navigate into your install folder (`cd [install_folder]`) and run the installation script. A CUDA-compatible Nvidia graphics card is required.

    Installation script options:
    *   `--cuda CUDAVERSION`: Specify your CUDA version (e.g., '12.4').
    *   `--pkg_manager MANAGER`: Specify 'mamba' or 'conda' (default: 'conda').
    *   `--no-pyrosetta`: **Use this flag to install without PyRosetta.**
    *   `--fix-channels`: Fix conda channel configuration to resolve dependency conflicts (recommended if experiencing installation issues).

    **Example: PyRosetta-Free Installation**
    ```bash
    bash install_bindcraft.sh --cuda '12.4' --pkg_manager 'conda' --no-pyrosetta
    ```

    **Example: Standard Installation (Includes PyRosetta)**
    If you choose to install with PyRosetta, a license is required for commercial use.
    ```bash
    bash install_bindcraft.sh --cuda '12.4' --pkg_manager 'conda'
    ```

You can also run BindCraft entirely inside a Docker container without a local installation. See the Containerized usage section below for details and an interactive wrapper.

## Running BindCraft

Activate the Conda environment:
```bash
conda activate BindCraft
```

Change to your BindCraft installation directory:
```bash
# cd /path/to/your/bindcraft/folder/
```

**To use the PyRosetta bypass at runtime, include the `--no-pyrosetta` flag:**
```bash
python -u ./bindcraft.py --settings './settings_target/your_target.json' --filters './settings_filters/default_filters.json' --advanced './settings_advanced/default_4stage_multimer.json' --no-pyrosetta
```

**To run with PyRosetta enabled (assuming it was installed):**
```bash
python -u ./bindcraft.py --settings './settings_target/your_target.json' --filters './settings_filters/default_filters.json' --advanced './settings_advanced/default_4stage_multimer.json'
```

**Note:** Even if you installed BindCraft *with* PyRosetta, you can still run in bypass mode by adding the `--no-pyrosetta` flag at runtime.

For details on configuring target settings (`--settings`), filters (`--filters`), advanced parameters (`--advanced`), and other operational aspects of BindCraft, please consult the documentation in the [original BindCraft repository](https://github.com/martinpacesa/BindCraft).

## Interactive CLI

If you run BindCraft without `--settings` in a terminal (TTY) or pass `--interactive`, an interactive setup wizard guides you through configuration.

- Quickstart (local):
  ```bash
  python bindcraft.py               # auto-detects TTY and enters interactive mode
  # or
  python bindcraft.py --interactive
  ```
- What it asks:
  - Project/binder name, input PDB path (validated must exist), output directory (auto-created)
  - Design type: Miniprotein (≥31 aa) or Peptide (8–30 aa)
    - Peptides: default length 8–25; filters limited to `peptide_filters`, `peptide_relaxed_filters`, `no_filters`; advanced limited to peptide profiles
    - Miniproteins: default length 65–150 (min ≥31); filters limited to `default_filters`, `relaxed_filters`, `no_filters`; advanced excludes peptide profiles
  - Verbose logging, plots, animations, and whether to run with PyRosetta
  - Ranking method for final designs: `i_pTM` (default) or `ipSAE`
- Behavior:
  - Generates a target settings JSON inside your chosen output directory and then runs the standard pipeline

## Additional New CLI Flags 

You can further control runtime behavior with these flags:

- `--verbose`: Enable detailed timing/progress logs for BindCraft internals.
- `--debug-pdbs`: Write intermediate PDBs from OpenMM relax (`.debug_deconcat.pdb`, `.debug_pdbfixer.pdb`, `.debug_post_initial_relax.pdb`, `.debug_post_faspr.pdb`)
- `--no-plots`: Disable saving design trajectory plots (overrides advanced settings).
- `--no-animations`: Disable saving trajectory animations (overrides advanced settings).
- `--rank-by {i_pTM,ipSAE}`: Metric to rank final designs by (default: `i_pTM`). Use `ipSAE` to rank by interface predicted Structural Alignment Error instead.

Example:
```bash
python -u ./bindcraft.py \
  --settings './settings_target/your_target.json' \
  --filters './settings_filters/default_filters.json' \
  --advanced './settings_advanced/default_4stage_multimer.json' \
  --no-animations --no-plots --verbose --rank-by ipSAE
```

## Containerized usage (Docker)

Run FreeBindCraft in a GPU-enabled Docker container (build locally).

### Prerequisites (on the host)

- NVIDIA driver installed (check with `nvidia-smi`).
- Docker CE and NVIDIA Container Toolkit:
  - Linux (Ubuntu):
    1) Install Docker CE and restart the daemon.
    2) `sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit`
    3) `sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker`
  - Validate GPU availability inside containers:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
    ```

### Build the image from this repository

Build without PyRosetta (default):
```bash
docker build -t freebindcraft:gpu .
```

Build with PyRosetta:
```bash
docker build --build-arg WITH_PYROSETTA=true -t freebindcraft:pyrosetta .
```

Sanity test (OpenMM relax):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/bindcraft_out
docker run --gpus all --rm -it \
  --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 \
  -v ~/bindcraft_out:/work/out \
  freebindcraft:gpu \
  python extras/test_openmm_relax.py example/PDL1.pdb /work/out/relax_test
```

 

### Running BindCraft in Docker (general guidance)

Decide where your inputs and outputs live. Typical layout:
- Host input PDB: `/path/on/host/your_target.pdb`
- Host output dir: `/path/on/host/run_outputs`
- Settings files: either use repo defaults inside the container or mount your own copies from the host

Examples:
1) Use repository defaults for settings (inside container), but mount outputs to host.
```bash
mkdir -p /path/on/host/run_outputs
docker run --gpus all --rm -it \
  --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 \
  -v /path/on/host/run_outputs:/root/software/pdl1 \
  freebindcraft:gpu \
  python bindcraft.py \
    --settings settings_target/PDL1.json \
    --filters settings_filters/default_filters.json \
    --advanced settings_advanced/default_4stage_multimer.json \
    --no-pyrosetta
```

2) Mount a custom target settings JSON from the host (also mount your input PDB):
```bash
mkdir -p /path/on/host/run_outputs
docker run --gpus all --rm -it \
  --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 \
  -v /path/on/host/run_outputs:/root/software/pdl1 \
  -v /path/on/host/my_settings.json:/app/settings_target/my_settings.json:ro \
  -v /path/on/host/your_target.pdb:/app/example/your_target.pdb:ro \
  freebindcraft:gpu \
  python bindcraft.py \
    --settings /app/settings_target/my_settings.json \
    --filters settings_filters/default_filters.json \
    --advanced settings_advanced/default_4stage_multimer.json \
    --no-pyrosetta
```

3) Mount custom filters/advanced settings from the host too:
```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -it \
  --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 \
  -v /path/on/host/run_outputs:/root/software/pdl1 \
  -v /path/on/host/my_settings.json:/app/settings_target/my_settings.json:ro \
  -v /path/on/host/my_filters.json:/app/settings_filters/my_filters.json:ro \
  -v /path/on/host/my_advanced.json:/app/settings_advanced/my_advanced.json:ro \
  -v /path/on/host/your_target.pdb:/app/example/your_target.pdb:ro \
  freebindcraft:gpu \
  python bindcraft.py \
    --settings /app/settings_target/my_settings.json \
    --filters /app/settings_filters/my_filters.json \
    --advanced /app/settings_advanced/my_advanced.json \
    --no-pyrosetta
```

Notes:
- Always mount your output directory to the path set as `design_path` in your target settings (e.g., `/root/software/pdl1`).
- Always increase file descriptor limits with `--ulimit nofile=65536:65536`. The image’s entrypoint also attempts to raise the soft limit inside the container.

### Interactive wrapper for Docker

After you build an image locally, you can use the interactive Docker wrapper:

```bash
python docker_cli.py
```

This wizard:
- Lists local Docker images and lets you choose one (defaults to `freebindcraft:gpu` if present, or enter another local image tag such as `freebindcraft:pyrosetta`)
- Asks for a single GPU index to expose
- Prompts for all inputs identical to the local interactive CLI (design type, validated PDB path, output directory auto-created, chains, hotspots, peptide/miniprotein-specific filters and advanced profiles, verbose/plots/animations, PyRosetta, ranking method)
- Writes a target settings JSON into your chosen output directory
- Launches `docker run --rm -it --gpus device=<idx>` with host paths mounted to identical locations in the container so your paths work unchanged

On completion or Ctrl+C, the container exits and is auto-removed; outputs persist on the host via the mounted output directory.

## Known Issues

- OpenMM GPU backend selection (OpenCL preferred over CUDA): We deliberately prefer OpenCL over CUDA for OpenMM relax because we have not been able to get the CUDA backend reliably working in our environments. OpenCL works, but it is less stable over long runs, so the relax step is executed in a subprocess for isolation and reliability. It also produces JIT log spam; see the next item for a suppression example.
- OpenCL JIT "log spam": You may see repeated lines such as "Failed to read file: /tmp/dep-76532a.d" emitted to stdout/stderr during OpenCL kernel builds.
  - Recommend line buffering to keep logs responsive when filtering
    - Combined output (preferred when piping/teeing):
    ```bash
    python -u ./bindcraft.py \
      --settings ./settings_target/your_target.json \
      --filters ./settings_filters/default_filters.json \
      --advanced ./settings_advanced/default_4stage_multimer.json \
      --no-pyrosetta \
      |& stdbuf -oL -eL grep -v -E 'Failed to read file: .*/dep-[0-9a-fA-F]+\.d([[:space:]]*)?$' \
      | stdbuf -oL tee -a ./output/your_target.log
    ```
    - Stderr-only (no further pipes):
    ```bash
    python -u ./bindcraft.py \
      --settings ./settings_target/your_target.json \
      --filters ./settings_filters/default_filters.json \
      --advanced ./settings_advanced/default_4stage_multimer.json \
      --no-pyrosetta \
      2> >(stdbuf -oL -eL grep -v -E 'Failed to read file: .*/dep-[0-9a-fA-F]+\.d([[:space:]]*)?$' >&2)
    ```
    - Notes:
      - `stdbuf` forces line buffering for both stdout and stderr, preventing pipeline buffering delays.
      - Use POSIX character class `[[:space:]]` for portability.
      - If preserving exit code across pipes matters, consider: `set -o pipefail`.
